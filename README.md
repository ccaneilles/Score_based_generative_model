# Deep Learning ENSAE Project

*[Oscar Fossey](https://github.com/oscarfossey) (ENSAE) and [Charles Caneilles](https://github.com/ccaneilles) (ENSAE).*

This projet implement score_based generative modeling methods on the well known FashionMNIST dataset. This notebook is inspired by [the notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/120kYYBOVa1i0TD85RjlEkFjaWDxSFUx3?usp=sharing#scrollTo=GFuMaPov5HlV) of [Yang Song](https://yang-song.github.io/) who present this methods.

In this notebook you will find:
* Quick presentation of the FashionMNIST dataset
* Overview of score-based generative modeling
* Presentation and training of our scoring model
* Generation of synthetic data using differents sampling methods
* Conclusion and recall of the main differences between our notebook and the one from Yang Song
